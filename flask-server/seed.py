In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, salt, and water, kneading until a smooth and elastic dough is formed. Let it rest for about 30 minutes.

Roll out the dough on a floured surface, then cut it into small squares or circles. Take each piece of dough, place a small amount of the meat filling in the center, and fold the edges to form dumplings. Boil the manti in salted water until they float to the surface. In a serving dish, combine plain yogurt, minced garlic, and salt to prepare the yogurt sauce. In a separate saucepan, melt butter and add paprika and dried mint to create the spiced butter sauce. Serve the cooked manti in individual bowls, spooning yogurt sauce over them, and drizzling the spiced butter sauce on top. Optionally, garnish with dried mint or sumac.
